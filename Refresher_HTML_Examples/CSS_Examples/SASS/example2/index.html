    Here's an example of an HTML file and a Sass file that includes both a mixin without arguments and a mixin with arguments.
    In this example:
    The HTML file (index.html) contains three div elements with classes box1, box2, and box3.
    The Sass file (styles.scss) defines two mixins:
    important-text is a mixin without arguments that sets the text color, font size, and font weight.
    bordered is a mixin with arguments that sets the border color and width.
    The mixins are included in the styles for the box1, box2, and box3 classes.
    The compiled CSS file (styles.css) shows the resulting styles after the Sass is processed.
    You can compile the Sass file to CSS using a Sass compiler, such as the one provided by the Sass command-line tool or an online compiler.
