### Sorting Functions Explanation

#### 1. Sorting by Power

```javascript
// Function to sort characters by power
function sortByPower(characters) {
    return characters.sort((a, b) => b.statistics.power - a.statistics.power);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `sortByPower` function takes an array of `characters` as an argument.
- It uses the `sort` method to sort the array in descending order based on the `power` attribute in the `statistics` object of each character.
- The comparison function `(a, b) => b.statistics.power - a.statistics.power` compares the `power` values of two characters, `a` and `b`.
  - If `b.statistics.power` is greater than `a.statistics.power`, the result is positive, and `b` will be placed before `a`.
  - If `b.statistics.power` is less than `a.statistics.power`, the result is negative, and `a` will be placed before `b`.
  - If they are equal, their order remains unchanged.

#### 2. Sorting by Speed

```javascript
// Function to sort characters by speed
function sortBySpeed(characters) {
    return characters.sort((a, b) => b.statistics.speed - a.statistics.speed);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `sortBySpeed` function takes an array of `characters` as an argument.
- It uses the `sort` method to sort the array in descending order based on the `speed` attribute in the `statistics` object of each character.
- The comparison function `(a, b) => b.statistics.speed - a.statistics.speed` compares the `speed` values of two characters, `a` and `b`.
  - If `b.statistics.speed` is greater than `a.statistics.speed`, the result is positive, and `b` will be placed before `a`.
  - If `b.statistics.speed` is less than `a.statistics.speed`, the result is negative, and `a` will be placed before `b`.
  - If they are equal, their order remains unchanged.

#### 3. Sorting by Defense

```javascript
// Function to sort characters by defense
function sortByDefense(characters) {
    return characters.sort((a, b) => b.statistics.defense - a.statistics.defense);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `sortByDefense` function takes an array of `characters` as an argument.
- It uses the `sort` method to sort the array in descending order based on the `defense` attribute in the `statistics` object of each character.
- The comparison function `(a, b) => b.statistics.defense - a.statistics.defense` compares the `defense` values of two characters, `a` and `b`.
  - If `b.statistics.defense` is greater than `a.statistics.defense`, the result is positive, and `b` will be placed before `a`.
  - If `b.statistics.defense` is less than `a.statistics.defense`, the result is negative, and `a` will be placed before `b`.
  - If they are equal, their order remains unchanged.

These explanations should help your students understand how the sorting functions work and how the comparison logic is applied.
