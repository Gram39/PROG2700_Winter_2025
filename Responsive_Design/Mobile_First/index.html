    In this example:
    The HTML file (index.html) sets up a basic structure with a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer.
    The CSS file (styles.css) starts with styles for mobile devices:
    The body element is set to display as a flex container with a column direction and minimum height of 100vh.
    The main element is also a flex container with a column direction, ensuring that the content and sidebar stack vertically on small screens.
    The content and sidebar sections have padding and margin for spacing.
    A media query is included to adjust the layout for larger screens (min-width: 768px):
    The main element's flex-direction is changed to row, making the content and sidebar sit side by side.
    The content section takes up more space (flex: 3) than the sidebar (flex: 1).
    This approach ensures that the design is optimized for mobile devices first and then adapts to larger screens.
