    In this example:
    The HTML file (index.html) sets up a basic structure with a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer.
    The CSS file (styles.css) uses CSS Grid to create a responsive layout:
    The body element is set to display as a grid with three rows: one for the header, one for the main content, and one for the footer. The main content row (1fr) takes up the remaining space.
    The main element is also a grid container with two columns: the main content area (3fr) and the sidebar (1fr), with a gap between them.
    A media query is included to change the layout to a single column on smaller screens (max-width: 768px), making the content stack vertically.
